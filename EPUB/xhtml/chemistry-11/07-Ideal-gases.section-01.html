<h3>The kinetic theory of gases</h3>

<p>In grade <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\text{10}</annotation></semantics></math> you learnt about the kinetic theory of matter. The kinetic theory of matter says that all matter is composed of particles which have a certain amount of energy which allows them to move at different speeds depending on the temperature (energy). There are spaces between the particles and also attractive forces between particles when they come close together.</p>

<p>Now we will look at applying the same ideas to gases.</p>

<p>The main assumptions of the kinetic theory of gases are as follows:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
            
<p>Gases are made up of <strong>particles</strong> (e.g. atoms or molecules). The size of these particles is very small compared to the distance between the particles.</p>

          </li>
<li>
            
<p>These particles are constantly moving because they have kinetic energy. The particles move in straight lines at different speeds.</p>

          </li>
<li>
            
<p>There are <strong>attractive forces</strong> between particles. These forces are very weak for gases.</p>

          </li>
<li>
			  
<p>The collisions between particles and the walls of the container do not change the kinetic energy of the system.</p>

		  </li>
<li>
            
<p>The <strong>temperature</strong> of a gas is a measure of the <strong>average kinetic energy</strong> of the particles.</p>

          </li>
</ul><p>From these assumptions we can define the pressure and temperature of any gas.</p>
<dl class="definition"><dt>Pressure</dt><dd>The <strong>pressure</strong> of a gas is a measure of the number of collisions of the gas particles with each other and with the sides of the container that they are in.</dd></dl><p data-class="video" id="sc23VS"><a href="http://youtu.be/p3b9pK-O6cE">Video: 23VS</a></p><dl class="definition"><dt>Temperature</dt><dd>The <strong>temperature</strong> of a substance is a measure of the <strong>average kinetic energy</strong> of the particles.</dd></dl><p>If the gas is heated (i.e. the temperature increases), the average kinetic energy of the gas particles will increase and if the temperature is decreased, the average kinetic energy of the particles decreases. If the energy of the particles decreases significantly, the gas liquefies (becomes a liquid).</p>

<p>One of the assumptions of the kinetic theory of gases is that all particles have a different speed. However, this is only the case for a <strong>real</strong> gas. For an ideal gas we assume that all particles in the gas have the <strong>same</strong> speed.</p>

<p>So for an ideal gas we can simply talk about the speed of particles. But for a real gas we must use the average speed of all the particles.</p>

<p>When we look at the gas laws in the next section we will only deal with ideal gases.</p>
<dl class="definition"><dt>Ideal gas</dt><dd>
            
<p>An ideal gas has identical particles of zero volume, with no intermolecular forces between them. The atoms or molecules in an ideal gas move at the same speed.</p>

          </dd></dl><p>Almost all gases obey the gas laws within a limited range of pressures and temperatures. So we can use the gas laws to predict how real gases will behave.</p>
<dl class="definition"><dt>Real gas</dt><dd>
            
<p>Real gases behave more or less like ideal gases except at high pressures and low temperatures.</p>

          </dd></dl><p>Before we go on to look at the gas laws we will first see what happens to gases at high pressures and low temperatures.</p>

<p>When we defined an ideal gas, we said that an ideal gas has identical particles of zero volume and that there are no intermolecular forces between the particles in the gas. We need to look more closely at these statements because they affect how gases behave at high pressures or at low temperatures.</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
            
<p><em>Molecules do occupy volume</em></p>

    
            
<p>When pressures are very high and the molecules are compressed, the volume of the molecules becomes significant. This means that the total volume available for the gas molecules to move is reduced and collisions become more frequent. This causes the pressure of the gas to be <em>higher</em> than what would be expected for an ideal gas (Figure <a href="#fig-gas-real1" data-class="InternalLink">fig-gas-real1</a>).</p>

<p><em>Forces of attraction do exist between molecules</em></p>

            
            
<p>At low temperatures, when the speed of the molecules decreases and they move closer together, the intermolecular forces become more apparent. As the attraction between molecules increases, their movement decreases and there are fewer collisions between them. The pressure of the gas at low temperatures is therefore lower than what would have been expected for an ideal gas (Figure <a href="#fig-gas-real2" data-class="InternalLink">fig-gas-real2</a>). If the temperature is low enough or the pressure high enough, a real gas will <strong>liquefy</strong>.</p>

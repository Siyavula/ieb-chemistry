  <body><h2>What is chemical equilibrium?</h2>

<p>To define chemical equilibrium we need to ask some important questions about reactions:</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
	    
<p>Does a reaction always run its full course so that all the reactants are used up?</p>

	    <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
		
<p>When all the reactants in a reaction are used up the reaction is said to have <strong>gone to completion</strong>. However, in some reactions not all the reactants are used. <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Not all reactions go to completion}}</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

	      </li>
</ul></li>
<li>
	    
<p>Does a reaction always proceed in the same direction or can it be reversed? In other words, does a reaction always proceed <em>reactants <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\to</annotation></semantics></math> products</em>, or is it possible that a reaction will reverse and go <em>products <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\to</annotation></semantics></math> reactants</em>?</p>

	    <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
		
<p>Reactions that go to completion are <em>irreversible</em>. However, in some reactions the reactants form products (in a <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\textcolor{red}{\textbf{forward reaction}}</annotation></semantics></math>), and the products can change back into reactants (in a <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\textcolor{red}{\textbf{reverse reaction}}</annotation></semantics></math>).</p>

	      </li>
</ul></li>
<li>
	    
<p>Can a reaction reach a point where reactants are still present, but there does not seem to be any further change taking place in the reaction?</p>

	    <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
		
<p>In all reactions, as the amount of reactant in a reaction decreases the product is formed more slowly. In a reversible reaction, as the amount of product increases the reactant is formed more quickly. Eventually the rate of the forward reaction (reactants <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\to</annotation></semantics></math> products) equals the rate of the reverse reaction (products <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\to</annotation></semantics></math> reactants).</p>

		
<p>At this point there <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\textcolor{red}{\textbf{are still reactants present}}</annotation></semantics></math> but there does not <em>appear</em> to be any further change taking place. The reaction is said to be in <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{chemical}}</annotation></semantics></math><math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{equilibrium}}</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>

	      </li>
</ul></li>
</ol><p>Chemical equilibrium is the state of a reversible reaction where the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. While a reaction is in equilibrium the concentration of the reactants and products are constant.</p>
<dl class="definition"><dt>Chemical equilibrium</dt><dd>
              
<p>A reaction is in chemical equilibrium when the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction.</p>

            </dd></dl><p>There are many examples of chemical equilibrium all around you. One example is a bottle of fizzy cooldrink. In the bottle there is carbon dioxide (\(\text{CO}_{2}\)) dissolved in the liquid. There is also \(\text{CO}_{2}\) gas in the space between the liquid and the cap. There is a constant movement of \(\text{CO}_{2}\) from the liquid to the gas phase, and from the gas phase into the liquid. However, if you look at the bottle there does not appear to be any change. The system is in equilibrium.</p>

<p>\(\text{CO}_{2}(\text{g}) + \text{H}_{2}\text{O}(\text{&#8467;})\) <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\rightleftharpoons</annotation></semantics></math> \(\text{H}_{2}\text{CO}_{3}(\text{aq})\)</p>

<p>Without chemical equilibrium life as we know it would not be possible. Another example of equilibrium in our everyday lives goes on within our very bodies. Haemoglobin is a macromolecule that transports oxygen around our bodies. Without it we would not survive. The haemoglobin has to be able to take up oxgen, but also to release it and this is done through changes in the chemical equilibrium of this reaction in different places in our bodies.</p>

<p>haemoglobin(aq) + \(4\text{O}_{2}(\text{g})\) <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\rightleftharpoons</annotation></semantics></math> haemoglobin(\(\text{O}_{2})_{4}\)(aq)</p>
<div class="note" data-type="aside">
<p>Haemoglobin, inside red blood cells in the lungs, bonds with oxygen. This <em>oxyhaemoglobin</em> moves with the red blood cells through the blood stream to cells throughout the body.</p>

<p>This video is a good demonstration of how a reaction reaches equilibrium with time.</p>
<p data-class="video" id="scShortcode 1"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/C5jDmG4nVV8">Video: Shortcode 1</a></p><h3>Open and closed systems</h3>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The important thing for the students to understand in this experiment is that there is constant movement. Molecules at the surface of the water in the closed beaker are constantly evaporating, and gas molecules are constantly condensing. So although there is no change in the level of the liquid, the total number molecules in the liquid and the gas state remain constant.</p>

<p>Point out that the level of water in the sealed container also drops initially, before finally remaining constant. This concept will help learners understand how the rate of the forward reaction decreases until equilibrium is reached.</p>

<div class="section"><div class="title">Observations</div>
<p>You should notice that in the beaker that is uncovered, the water level drops more quickly than in the covered beaker. This is because of evaporation. In the beaker that is covered, there is an initial drop in the water level, but after a while evaporation appears to stop and the water level in this beaker is higher than that in the one that is open.</p>

<div class="section"><div class="title">Discussion</div>
<p>In the first beaker, liquid water becomes water vapour as a result of evaporation and the water level drops. A small amount of gas molecules will condense again, but because the gas molecules can escape from the system there is much less condensation than evaporation.</p>

<p>In the second beaker, evaporation also takes place. However, in this case, the vapour comes into contact with the surface of the glass cover and it cools and condenses to form liquid water again. This water is returned to the beaker. Once condensation has begun, the rate at which the water level drops will start to decrease. At some point, the rate of evaporation will be equal to the rate of condensation, and there will be no change in the water level in the beaker. This can be represented as follows:</p>

<p><strong><math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\text{liquid} \rightleftharpoons \text{vapour}</annotation></semantics></math></strong></p>

<p>In this example, the reaction (in this case, a change in the phase of water) can proceed in either direction. In the forward direction there is a change in phase from liquid to gas, present here as water vapour. A reverse change can also take place, when vapour condenses to form liquid again.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="note" data-type="aside">
<p><strong>Evaporation</strong> is when a substance goes from the liquid phase to the gas phase (it evaporates). <strong>Condensation</strong> is when a substance goes from the gas phase to the liquid phase (it condenses).</p>

<p>The bottle contains water vapour (gas) and water droplets are condensing on the side of the bottle.</p>
<figure class="figure"><img src="photos/condensation.jpg" width="195" alt="Photo by Muffet on Flickr"/></figure></div>
<p>An <strong>open system</strong> is one in which matter or energy can flow into or out of the system. In the liquid-gas demonstration we used, the first beaker was an example of an open system because the beaker could be heated or cooled (a change in <em>energy</em>), and water vapour (the <em>matter</em>) could evaporate from the beaker.</p>
<dl class="definition"><dt>Open system</dt><dd>
	      
<p>An <em>open system</em> is one whose borders allow the movement of <strong>energy and matter</strong> into and out of the system.</p>

            </dd></dl><p>A <strong>closed system</strong> is one in which energy can enter or leave, but matter cannot. The second beaker with the glass cover is an example of a closed system. The beaker can still be heated or cooled, but water vapour cannot leave the system because the glass cover is a barrier. Condensation changes the vapour to liquid and returns it to the beaker. In other words, there is no loss of matter from the system.</p>
<div class="note" data-type="aside">
<p>Generally, some of the molecules at the surface of liquids and solids are moving into the gas phase. This means that matter is leaving the system. However, this is such a small fraction of the total volume of the liquid or solid that a reaction involving only solids or liquids can be considered a closed system.</p>
</div><div class="note" data-type="aside">
<p>It is useful to simplify situations in science by dividing the world into the <em>system</em> we are studying, and the surrounding environment that might influence the reaction, but is not part of it.</p>
</div><dl class="definition"><dt>Closed system</dt><dd>
	      
<p>A <em>closed system</em> is one in which <strong>only energy</strong> can move into and out of the system. Matter cannot be gained by the system nor lost from the system.</p>

            </dd></dl><p>In a <strong>closed system</strong> it is possible for reactions to be reversible, such as in the demonstration above. In a closed system, it is also possible for a chemical reaction to reach <strong>equilibrium</strong>.</p>
<h3>Reversible reactions</h3>

<p>Some reactions can take place in two directions. In one direction the reactants combine to form the products. This is called the <strong><math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\textcolor{orange}{\text{forward reaction}}</annotation></semantics></math></strong>. In the other direction, the products react to form the reactants again. This is called the <strong><math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\textcolor{purple}{\text{reverse reaction}}</annotation></semantics></math></strong>. A special double-headed arrow ( <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">&#8652;</annotation></semantics></math>) is used to show this type of <strong><math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\textcolor{blue}{\text{reversible reaction}}</annotation></semantics></math></strong>:</p>

<p>\(\text{XY} + \text{Z}\) <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">&#8652;</annotation></semantics></math> \(\text{X} + \text{YZ}\)</p>
<dl class="definition"><dt>A reversible reaction</dt><dd>
              
<p>A reversible reaction is a chemical reaction that can proceed in both the forward and reverse directions. In other words, the reactants and products of the reaction may reverse roles.</p>

            </dd></dl><div class="note" data-type="aside">
<p>Remember that <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\to</annotation></semantics></math> implies that A goes to B and cannot become A again. <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\rightleftharpoons</annotation></semantics></math> implies that the reaction is reversible. A can go to B and B can go to A.</p>
</div>
<p>So, in the following reversible reaction:</p>

<p><math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\overset{\textcolor{orange}{\textbf{forward }\longrightarrow}}{\textcolor{blue}{{\text{H}}_{2}{\text{(g)}} + {\text{I}}_{2}{\text{(g)}}}} {\textcolor{blue}{&#8652;}} {\underset{\textcolor{purple}{\longleftarrow\textbf{ reverse}}}{\textcolor{blue}{\text{2HI(g)}}}}</annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p>The forward reaction is always taken from the given equation and written: <strong>left</strong> to <strong>right</strong>.</p>

<p><math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\textcolor{purple}{{\text{2HI(g)}} \to {\text{H}}_{2}{\text{(g)}} + {\text{I}}_{2}{\text{(g)}}}\phantom{\rule{4.pt}{0ex}}</annotation></semantics></math> is the <em><math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\textcolor{purple}{\text{reverse}}</annotation></semantics></math></em> reaction.</p>

<p>We will use the same reversible reaction that we used in an earlier example:</p>

<p><math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\textcolor{blue}{\text{H}_{2}{\text{(g)}} + {\text{I}}_{2}{\text{(g)}} \rightleftharpoons {\text{2HI(g)}}}</annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p>The <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\textcolor{purple}{\text{reverse}}</annotation></semantics></math> reaction is: <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\phantom{\rule{4.pt}{0ex}}\textcolor{purple}{\text{2HI(g)} \to {\text{H}}_{2}{\text{(g)}} + {\text{I}}_{2}{\text{(g)}}}</annotation></semantics></math></p>

<p>When the rate of the forward reaction and the rate of the reverse reaction are equal, the system is said to be in <strong><math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\textcolor{blue}{\text{equilibrium}}</annotation></semantics></math></strong>. Figure <a href="#fig-chemequil-equilibrium" data-class="InternalLink">fig-chemequil-equilibrium</a> shows this. Initially (time = <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\text{0}</annotation></semantics></math>), the rate of the <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\textcolor{orange}{\text{forward reaction}}</annotation></semantics></math> is high (fast). With time, the rate of the <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\textcolor{orange}{\text{forward reaction decreases}}</annotation></semantics></math>. As the reaction gets closer to equilibrium the rate of decrease levels out until the forward reaction has a constant rate.</p>

<p>Initially the rate of the <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\textcolor{purple}{\text{reverse reaction}}</annotation></semantics></math> is low (slow). As the reaction proceeds with time, the rate of the <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\textcolor{purple}{\text{reverse reaction increases}}</annotation></semantics></math>. As the reaction progresses the rate of increase levels out until the reverse reaction has a constant rate.</p>

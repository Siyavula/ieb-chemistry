<div class="teachers-guide">
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>This section studies simple organic molecules, functional groups and the physical properties associated with these functional groups. Only molecules with one type of functional group, and no more than three of the same functional group, should be studied. This section is a basis for any organic chemistry they may study beyond school so it is important that learners have a thorough understanding of this chapter. Some common polymers are also covered in this chapter, learners should understand the environmental impacts of these polymers as well as their connection with simple organic molecules through the simple monomers they are formed from.</p>

<p><strong>Prior knowledge</strong></p>

<p>This section of work is the first chemistry chapter of the Grade 12 year. Although this is their first real introduction to organic molecules they should have an understanding of intermolecular forces from Grade 11. These will be particularly important in the physical properties section.</p>

<p><strong>Planning</strong></p>

<p>CAPS allocates 12 hours for this section. If possible more time could be given here to ensure a thorough understanding as there is a lot of work to cover.</p>

<p>Do not confuse organic compounds with <em>naturally produced</em> food. Organic compounds are often produced in a laboratory.</p>

<p><strong>Organic chemistry</strong> is the branch of chemistry that deals with <strong>organic molecules</strong>. An organic molecule is one which contains <strong>carbon</strong>, and these molecules can range in size from simple molecules to complex structures containing thousands of atoms! Not all compounds that contain carbon are organic molecules. Noticeable exceptions are carbon monoxide (<math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\text{CO}</annotation></semantics></math>), carbon dioxide (<math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\text{CO}_{2}</annotation></semantics></math>), carbonates (e.g. calcium carbonate), carbides (e.g. calcium carbide) and cyanides (e.g. sodium cyanide). Pure carbon compounds such as diamond and graphite are also <strong>not</strong> organic compounds.</p>

<p>Although carbon is present in all organic compounds, other elements such as hydrogen <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">(\text{H})</annotation></semantics></math>, oxygen <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">(\text{O})</annotation></semantics></math>, nitrogen <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">(\text{N})</annotation></semantics></math>, sulfur <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">(\text{S})</annotation></semantics></math> and phosphorus <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">(\text{P})</annotation></semantics></math> are also common in these molecules.</p>

	  </figcaption></figure><p>Organic compounds are very important in daily life and they range from simple to extremely complex (Figure <a href="#fig-organic-molecules" data-class="InternalLink">fig-organic-molecules</a>). Organic molecules make up a big part of our own bodies, they are in the food we eat and in the clothes we wear. Organic compounds are also used to make products such as medicines, plastics, washing powders, dyes, along with a long list of other items. There are millions organic compounds found in nature, as well as millions of synthetic (man-made) organic compounds.</p>

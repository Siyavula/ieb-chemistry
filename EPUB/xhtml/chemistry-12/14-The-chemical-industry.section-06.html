<p>The fertiliser industry is a very important industry in South Africa and in the world. It helps provide the nutrients that we need to ensure healthy crops to sustain life on Earth. However, fertilisers can also <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="https://vula.uct.ac.za/access/content/group/9eafe770-4c41-4742-a414-0df36366abe6/Chem%20Ind%20Resource%20Pack/html/learner-sheets/F/LS_F12.pdf">harm the environment</a> if they are not used in a responsible manner. This section will focus on some of the environmental problems that excessive use of fertilisers can cause.</p>
<h3>Eutrophication</h3>

<p>Eutrophication (Figure <a href="#fig-chemind-algalbloom" data-class="InternalLink">fig-chemind-algalbloom</a>) is the enrichment of an ecosystem with large quantities of chemical compounds, mostly containing the nutrients <strong>nitrogen</strong> and <strong>phosphorus</strong>. Eutrophication is considered a form of <strong>pollution</strong> because it promotes excessive plant growth, favouring certain species over others. In aquatic environments, the rapid growth of certain types of plants can <strong>disrupt the normal functioning of an ecosystem</strong>, causing a variety of problems. Human society is impacted as well, as health-related problems can occur if eutrophic conditions interfere with the treatment of drinking water. Eutrophication can also decrease the resource value of rivers, lakes, and estuaries.</p>

</p><p>An example of the effect of eutrophication (algal bloom).</p>

	    </figcaption></figure><dl class="definition"><dt>Eutrophication</dt><dd>Eutrophication refers to an over-supply in chemical nutrients in an ecosystem, leading to the depletion of oxygen in a water system through excessive plant growth. These chemical nutrients usually contain nitrogen or phosphorus.</dd></dl><p>In some cases, eutrophication can be a natural process that occurs very slowly over time.  However, it can also be accelerated by certain human activities.  <strong>Agricultural runoff</strong>, where excess fertilisers are washed off fields and into ground water, and <strong>sewage</strong>, are two of the major causes of eutrophication. The impacts of eutrophication are the following:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
	      
<p><strong>A decrease in biodiversity (the number of plant and animal species in an ecosystem)</strong></p>

	      
<p>When a system is enriched with nitrogen, plant growth is accelerated. When the number of plants increases in an aquatic system, it can block light from reaching deeper water. Plants also consume oxygen for respiration, depleting the oxygen content of the water, which can cause other organisms, such as fish, to die.</p>

	    </li>
<li>
	      
<p><strong>Toxicity</strong></p>

	      
<p>In certain instances the plants that flourish during eutrophication can be toxic and these toxins may accumulate in the food chain.</p>

	    </li>
</ul><div class="note" data-type="aside">
<p>A buffer zone is an area that lies between two other areas, for example, a farm and a river. It is an area of land designated for environmental protection.</p>
</div>
<p>Despite these impacts, there are a number of ways to prevent eutrophication from taking place.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention of eutrophication:</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
	      
<p>Clean-up measures can directly remove the excess nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus from the water.</p>

	    </li>
<li>
	      
<p>Creating buffer zones near farms, roads and rivers can also help. These act as filters and cause nutrients and sediments to be deposited there instead of in the aquatic system.</p>

	    </li>
<li>
	      
<p>Laws relating to the treatment and discharge of sewage can also help to control eutrophication.</p>

	    </li>
<li>
	      
<p>A final possible intervention is nitrogen testing and modelling. By assessing exactly how much fertiliser is needed by crops and other plants, farmers can make sure that they apply only the required amount of fertiliser. This means that there is no excess to run off into neighbouring streams when it rains. This includes a cost benefit for the farmer as they are less likely to waste fertiliser.</p>

	    </li>
</ul><div class="note" data-type="aside">
<p>South Africa's Department of Water Affairs and Forestry has a <em>National Eutrophication Monitoring Programme</em>, which was set up to monitor eutrophication in impoundments such as dams, where no monitoring was taking place.</p>

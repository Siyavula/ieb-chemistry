<h3>The importance of nutrients</h3>

<p>Nutrients are very important for life to exist. An <strong>essential nutrient</strong> is a chemical that a plant needs to be able to grow from a seed and complete its life cycle, but that it cannot produce itself. The same is true for animals. A <strong>macronutrient</strong> is a chemical element that is required in <em>large quantities</em> by the plant or animal, whereas a <strong>micronutrient</strong> is only needed in <em>small amounts</em> for a plant or an animal to function properly.</p>
<dl class="definition"><dt>Nutrient</dt><dd>A nutrient is a chemical substance used for the metabolism and the physiology of an organism and is absorbed from the environment.</dd></dl><p>In plants, examples of <em>macronutrients</em> include carbon (\(\text{C}\)), hydrogen (\(\text{H}\)), oxygen (\(\text{O}\)), nitrogen (\(\text{N}\)), phosphorus (\(\text{P}\)) and potassium (\(\text{K}\)), while <em>micronutrients</em> include iron (\(\text{Fe}\)), chlorine (\(\text{Cl}\)), copper (\(\text{Cu}\)) and zinc (\(\text{Zn}\)).</p>

<p>Nutrients that plants absorb <strong>from the soil</strong> are called <em>mineral nutrients</em>. Mineral nutrients have to dissolve in the water in the soil before plants can absorb them. <strong>Non-mineral nutrients</strong> are <em>not provided by the soil</em> itself, but from the environment. For example oxygen and hydrogen can be obtained from rain water, while carbon, in the form of carbon dioxide (\(\text{CO}_{2}\)) is obtained from the air. The source of each of these nutrients for plants, and their function, is summarised in Table <a href="#tab-chemind-nonmineralnutrientsource" data-class="InternalLink">tab-chemind-nonmineralnutrientsource</a> (for non-mineral nutrients) and Table <a href="#tab-chemind-mineralnutrientsource" data-class="InternalLink">tab-chemind-mineralnutrientsource</a> (for mineral nutrients).</p>

	    </div></figure><p>Animals need similar nutrients in order to survive. However, since animals do not photosynthesise, they rely on plants to supply them with the nutrients they need. Think of the human diet - we cannot synthesise our own food and so we either need to eat vegetables, fruits and seeds (all of which are direct plant products) or the meat of other animals which would have fed on plants. It is important therefore that plants are always able to access the nutrients that they need so that they will grow and provide food for other forms of life.</p>

<p><strong>Mindmap activity: The importance of nutrients</strong></p>

<p>Purpose of the activity:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
		
<p>To summarise the content for study purposes</p>

	      </li>
<li>
		
<p>To teach learners one method of summarising content</p>

<p>In this activity you are going to make a concept map of this section as a summary that you can use when you study.</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
		
<p>Read through the content on the first two pages of this chapter.</p>

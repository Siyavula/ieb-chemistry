  <body><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A car slowly rusting away, a match burning, a tablet dissolving in water. All of these are chemical reactions and all of these take place at different rates. If you were to hold a race between these three reactions you would find that the match wins (it burns quickly), while the car rusting would lose (it may take years to rust).</p>

<div class="note" data-type="aside">
<p>In physics, speed is the scalar measurement that tells us how fast or slow an object is moving (position vs. time). For reactions the speed (or rate) of a reaction means how fast or slow the reaction is and indicates the amount of product and the amount of reactants used per unit time.</p>

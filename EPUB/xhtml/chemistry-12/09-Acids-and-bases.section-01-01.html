<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>In this chapter learners will look at acids and bases. In Grade 11 learners were introduced to a lot of the concepts that are expanded on in this chapter. These include acid and base models and definitions, conjugate acid-base pairs, and some basic acid-base reactions. It is important that the learners have a good understanding of the work covered in <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="todo">Chapter 8</a>, specifically equilibrium constants, before studying this chapter.</p>

<p>New concepts related to acids and bases will also be covered in this chapter. These include pH, more in depth information on titrations and indicators, and real world applications of acids and bases.</p>

<p>The following topics are covered in this chapter.</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
	    
<p><strong>What are acids and bases?</strong></p>

	    
<p>This section is largely revision from Grade 11. The Arrhenius and Br&#248;nsted-Lowry models for acids and bases are discussed. Conjugate acid-base pairs are also covered in detail in this section, including worked examples on how to determine the conjugate base of an acid and the conjugate acid of a base.</p>

	  </li>
<li>
	    
<p><strong>Strong and weak acids and bases, and concentrated and dilute solutions</strong></p>

	    
<p>The concept of strong and weak acids and bases is often confused with the concept of concentrated and dilute solutions. It is important that the learners understand the difference between these concepts, which are discussed in detail in this section. The exercises will help to determine if the learners truly understand this work.</p>

	  </li>

<p><strong><math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\text{K}_{\text{a}}</annotation></semantics></math> and <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\text{K}_{\text{b}}</annotation></semantics></math></strong></p>

	    
<p>Although learners will not have encountered these terms before, the idea of an equilibrium constant should be familiar to them after encountering the equilibrium constant (<math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\text{K}_{\text{c}}</annotation></semantics></math>) in <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="todo">Chapter 8</a>. The values of <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\text{K}_{\text{a}}</annotation></semantics></math> and <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\text{K}_{\text{b}}</annotation></semantics></math> should be tied to the ideas of strong and weak acids and bases.</p>

	  </li>
<li>
	    
<p><strong>Acid-base reactions</strong></p>

	    
<p>These neutralisation reactions should be familiar to learners from Grade 11. They should revise these reactions through the revision activity provided. It is important that learners undersand how salts are formed from the acid and base, as well as the other products that are likely in each type of reaction.</p>

	  </li>
<li>
	    
<p><strong>pH</strong></p>

	    
<p>The pH scale is a logarithmic scale with a base of <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\text{10}</annotation></semantics></math>. So a change in pH of <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\text{3}</annotation></semantics></math> is a significant change in the concentration of <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\text{H}^{+}</annotation></semantics></math> ions. A good understanding of pH is also essential to understanding how indicators work. This section covers why a neutralised solution will not necessarily have a pH of <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\text{7}</annotation></semantics></math>, the concept of <math><semantics><mtext>CLICKME</mtext><annotation encoding="TeX">\text{K}_{\text{w}}</annotation></semantics></math>, and the hydrolysis of salts. Indicators are also covered in this section and it important that learners understand how to choose an indicator for an experiment 
before starting the next section on titrations.</p>

	  </li>
<li>
	    
<p><strong>Titrations</strong></p>

	    
<p>Titrations are covered in great detail in this section. This includes learners preparing their own standard solutions, performing several titration experiments, and doing titration calculations. The learners will be working with acids and bases a lot in this section and so should be reminded of proper laboratory safety procedures. Each experiment will take a large amount of time and at least an entire class should be dedicated to these experiments. If possible one class should be for the preparation of a standard solution and the first titration experiment, while another, separate class is for to the second titration experiment.</p>

	  </li>
<li>
	    
<p><strong>Applications of acids and bases</strong></p>

	    
<p>The applications covered are the production of chlorine in industry and the use of bases in hair products. The production of chlorine is not covered in great detail in this chapter, for more detail see <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="todo">Chapter 13</a>. The hair care products discussed include: hair permanent waving applications, hair relaxers, and hair dyes. The learners must also perform an experiment using drain cleaners or caustic soda. These products have a high pH and can burn skin. This lesson can also be used to consolidate information by going through the chapter summary and doing the end of chapter exercises.</p>

	  </li>
</ul><p>There are several experiments in this chapter. The learners will be using dangerous chemicals and should be properly instructed on the correct use of safety equipment, including safety goggles, gloves and protective clothing. They should also be reminded not to sniff any chemicals as the fumes can be dangerous as well. More information on laboratory procedures as well as safety precautions is provided in <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="todo">Chapter 1</a> (Science skills).</p>

<p>In the informal assessment the learners must determine the temperature change caused by the exothermic reaction of sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid. They should understand why the temperature stops changing when all the sodium hydroxide has been neutralised.</p>

<p>The formal assessment requires that the learners prepare a standard solution of sodium hydroxide. It is important that the learners understand why the mass must be known to a high accuracy, why the beakers must be rinsed with water (with the rinsings added to the volumetric flask), why the sides of the volumetric flask must be washed with water, and why it is important to have their eye level with the mark on the volumetric flask when filling to that
	  mark.</p>
</div><h3>What are acids and bases?</h3>

<p>We encounter many examples of acids and bases in our daily lives. Some common examples of household items that contain acids are vinegar (contains acetic acid), lemon juice (contains citric and ascorbic acid), wine (contains tartaric acid). These acids are often found to have a sour taste. Hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and nitric acid are examples of acids that are more likely to be found in laboratories and industry.</p>

</p><p>Some common household acids.</p>

	    </figcaption></figure><p>Hydrochloric acid is also found in the gastric juices in the stomach. Fizzy drinks contain carbonic acid, while tea and wine contain tannic acid. People even use acids in an artistic process known as <em>acid etching</em>. In acid etching, a metal is covered in a waxy material that is resistant to acid. The bare metal is then exposed in the desired pattern and the sample is placed in an acid bath. The top layers of the exposed metal are permanently removed, creating the desired image. Some examples of this are shown below (Figure <a href="#fig-acidsandbases-acidetching" data-class="InternalLink">fig-acidsandbases-acidetching</a>).</p>

	    </figcaption></figure><p>Bases that you may know about include sodium hydroxide (commonly known as caustic soda), ammonium hydroxide and ammonia. Some of these are found in household cleaning products. Bases are usually found to have a bitter taste and feel <em>slippery</em> (soap is a good example). Acids and bases are also important commercial components in the fertiliser, plastics, and petroleum refining industries. Some common acids and bases, and their chemical formulae, are shown in Table <a href="#tab-acids and bases" data-class="InternalLink">tab-acids and bases</a>.</p>

<p>Do research on three naturally occurring acids, and one naturally occurring base. That is, acids and bases that are found mostly in plants (not man-made).</p>

<p>Your research should include:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
		
<p>Where the acid or base is found (e.g. the plant in which it occurs).</p>

	      </li>
<li>
		
<p>Indigenous uses of the plant.</p>

	      </li>
<li>
		
<p>What the chemical composition of the acid or base is.</p>

	      </li>
</ul></div>

<p>The next section deals with some models used to describe acids and bases. It is important to have a definition so that acids and bases can be correctly identified in reactions.</p>
